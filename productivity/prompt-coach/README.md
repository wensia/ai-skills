## Usage

**IMPORTANT:** This skill analyzes logs from **THIS machine only**. It can only access Claude Code session logs stored locally in `~/.claude/projects/`.

### Option 1: Analyze All Projects

Just ask Claude natural questions about your usage across all projects:

```
"How much have I spent on tokens this month?"
"Analyze my prompt quality from last week"
"Which tools do I use most?"
"Show me my productivity patterns"
"What files do I edit most often?"
"When am I most efficient?"
```

Claude will automatically read all your session logs and provide detailed analysis.

### Option 2: List Projects First, Then Pick One

If you want to see what projects have logs and choose one:

```
"List all projects with Claude Code logs"
"Show me which projects I've worked on"
"What projects do I have session logs for?"
```

Claude will show you all available projects with details (sessions count, date range, size), and you can pick which one to analyze.

### Option 3: Analyze a Specific Project

If you know the project path, analyze just that project:

```
"Analyze my prompt quality for the project under ~/code/youtube/transcript/mcp"

"Analyze my prompt quality for /Users/username/code/my-app and save it as report.md"

"Show me token usage for the project in ~/code/experiments"

"What tools do I use most in the ~/code/my-app project?"
```

This analyzes **only the logs for that specific project**, giving you focused insights.

## How It Works

The skill provides Claude with:
- **Official Claude prompt engineering best practices** from Anthropic's documentation
- Knowledge of where logs are stored (`~/.claude/projects/`)
- Understanding of the JSONL log format
- A scoring system for prompt quality (Clarity, Specificity, Actionability, Scope)
- Patterns to look for (tool usage, tokens, timestamps, etc.)
- Instructions on how to calculate metrics
- Templates for presenting insights

Claude then uses its built-in tools (Read, Bash, Grep) to:
1. Find and read your log files
2. Parse the JSON data
3. Score your prompts against official best practices
4. Calculate metrics
5. Generate personalized, actionable insights

**No external dependencies, no installations, no data leaving your machine.**

## Prompt Engineering Knowledge

The skill is trained on official Claude prompt engineering guidelines, including:

### The Golden Rule
**"Show your prompt to a colleague with minimal context. If they're confused, Claude will likely be too."**

### Prompt Engineering Hierarchy (What Works Best)
1. ⭐ **Be Clear and Direct** - Most effective
2. **Use Examples (Multishot)** - Show desired output
3. **Let Claude Think** - Chain of thought reasoning
4. **Use XML Tags** - Structure for clarity
5. **Give Claude a Role** - Set context
6. **Prefill Responses** - Guide output format
7. **Chain Complex Prompts** - Break into steps

When analyzing your prompts, the skill evaluates them against these techniques and provides specific recommendations for improvement.

## Skill Design: Prompt Engineering in Action

The `Skill.md` file itself is a masterclass in prompt engineering, practicing what it preaches. Here's how it's constructed:

### Core Techniques Applied

**1. Clear Role Definition (System Prompts)**
- Establishes Claude as "an AI-native engineering expert and prompt engineering specialist"
- Defines domain expertise upfront (lines 9-15)
- Sets clear expectations for behavior and knowledge

**2. Hierarchical Structure & Organization**
- Markdown headers create clear information hierarchy
- Numbered step-by-step instructions for each analysis task
- Visual indicators (emojis, ASCII art) for quick pattern recognition
- Logical flow from general concepts to specific implementations

**3. Extensive Examples (Multishot Prompting)**
- Full example outputs for every analysis type (Token Usage, Prompt Quality, etc.)
- Before/after comparisons showing good vs. bad prompts
- Real-world scenarios with context-aware scoring
- Template patterns for reusable prompt structures

**4. Step-by-Step Instructions (Chain of Thought)**
- Each analysis task includes 5-10 explicit steps
- Sequential reasoning from data collection to insight generation
- Clear decision trees (e.g., context-aware analysis logic)
- Systematic approach to subjective evaluation

**5. Specificity & Actionability**
- Exact file paths: `~/.claude/projects/*.jsonl`
- Precise JSON field names: `usage.input_tokens`, `message.content`
- Current pricing data: $3 per 1M input tokens
- Specific patterns to detect: "Could you clarify", "Which file"
- Concrete scoring criteria: Clarity (0-10), Specificity (0-10)

**6. Success Criteria Definition**
- Explicit scoring guidelines with ranges (8-10 = Excellent, 5-7 = Good, etc.)
- Examples of what scores mean in practice
- Clear metrics for evaluation (clarification rate, iteration count)
- Quantified outcomes (time saved, efficiency improvements)

**7. Edge Cases & Error Handling**
- Explicit limitations section (what CAN'T be analyzed)
- Context-aware analysis with conditional logic
- Privacy considerations and parsing safeguards
- Handling of ambiguous or brief prompts with environmental context

**8. Templates & Reusable Patterns**
- Prompt templates: `"[action] in [file path] [details]"`
- Error reporting template: `"fix [error message] in [file] - expected [X], getting [Y]"`
- Success criteria template: `"[action] to achieve [specific measurable outcome]"`
- Analysis output format templates for consistency

**9. Comparative Analysis (Good vs Bad)**
- Systematic contrasts between effective and ineffective approaches
- Context-rich brief prompts (✅ "git commit") vs context-poor vague prompts (❌ "fix the bug")
- Visual markers (✅/❌) for instant clarity
- Explanations of why each example works or fails

**10. Meta-Instructions & Critical Insights**
- "Understanding Context in Prompt Quality" section teaches analysis methodology
- Two dimensions of quality: explicit information + implicit context
- Recognition patterns for different types of context (git, file, conversation)
- Nuanced guidance on when brevity is good vs. when it's problematic

### Why This Design Works

The skill file follows the **same hierarchy** it teaches (lines 160-197 in Skill.md):

1. ⭐ **Clear and Direct** - Every instruction is explicit and unambiguous
2. **Examples** - Demonstrates desired outputs with real-world scenarios
3. **Chain of Thought** - Breaks complex analysis into step-by-step processes
4. **Structure** - XML-like markers and markdown for organization
5. **Role Definition** - Sets expertise context upfront
6. **Templates** - Provides reusable patterns
7. **Chaining** - Sequences of steps for complex tasks

### Design Principles Used

- **No Ambiguity**: Every term is defined, every pattern is specified
- **Actionable Instructions**: Claude knows exactly what to do at each step
- **Context-Aware**: Recognizes when brevity is efficient vs. when it's vague
- **Example-Rich**: Shows don't tell - extensive demonstrations of desired behavior
- **Self-Referential**: The skill itself models excellent prompt engineering

This meta-design approach ensures that Claude not only *knows* prompt engineering best practices but actively *demonstrates* them when teaching users about their own prompts.
