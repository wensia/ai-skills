## 📋 Deduplication Summary

**CRITICAL:** Claude Code logs streaming responses multiple times with the same `requestId`. Without deduplication, token analysis would **overcount by 9.72x** and show incorrect costs.

### Deduplication Results

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total Log Entries Found** | 44,217 |
| **Duplicate Entries** | 6,508 (14.7%) |
| **Unique API Calls** | 4,549 |
| **Duplication Factor** | 9.72x |

**Deduplication Method:** Used `requestId` field to identify unique API calls. Each `requestId` represents one API request, but Claude Code logs it multiple times as the response streams in.

**Impact:** Without deduplication, the analysis would have reported **$2,791.43** instead of **$287.03** - a 9.72x overestimate!

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Simple file operations             → Haiku 4.5
Running tests/builds               → Haiku 4.5
Git operations                     → Haiku 4.5
Basic edits and refactoring        → Haiku 4.5

Most coding tasks                  → Sonnet 4.5
Complex debugging                  → Sonnet 4.5
Architecture design                → Sonnet 4.5
Code review                        → Sonnet 4.5

Exceptionally difficult problems   → Opus 4.1
Critical system changes            → Opus 4.1
Complex algorithmic challenges     → Opus 4.1
```

**Rule of thumb:**
- Haiku: "Can I describe this in one sentence?" → Use Haiku
- Sonnet: "Do I need to think through this?" → Use Sonnet
- Opus: "Is this make-or-break critical?" → Use Opus
